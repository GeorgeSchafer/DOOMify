# DOOMify

DOOMify is a suite of plug-ins for the GIMP to make converting textures for use in DOOM source ports with that DOOM 93 aesthetic easy.

## Setup

Created a folder called "resized" (all lowercase) in the folder holding your full-sized textures. This is necessary for the resizing functions to export scaled items into a folder.

## Instructions

Simply copy the scripts into the GIMP plug-ins folder. Use the file paths below as a guide.

### GIMP 2.X
